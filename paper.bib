abstract = {In this paper we extend operational transformation to support synchronous collaborative editing of documents written in dialects of SGML (Standard General Markup Language) such as XML and HTML, based on SGML's abstract data model, the grove. We argue that concurrent updates to a shared grove must be transformed before being applied to each replica to ensure consistency. We express grove operations as property changes on positionally-addressed nodes, define a set of transformation functions, and show how to apply an existing generic operational transformation algorithm to achieve this. This result makes synchronous group editing applicable to the modern Web.},

abstract = {This paper describes Collabode, a web-based Java integrated development environment designed to support close, synchronous collaboration between programmers. We examine the problem of collaborative coding in the face of program compilation errors introduced by other users which make collaboration more difficult, and describe an algorithm for error-mediated integration of program code. Concurrent editors see the text of changes made by collaborators, but the errors reported in their view are based only on their own changes. Editors may run the program at any time, using only error-free edits supplied so far, and ignoring incomplete or otherwise error-generating changes. We evaluate this algorithm and interface on recorded data from previous pilot experiments with Collabode, and via a user study with student and professional programmers. We conclude that it offers appreciable benefits over naive continuous synchronization without regard to errors and over manual version control.},

abstract = {Spreadsheets allow end users to blend calculations with arbitrary layout and formatting. However, when it comes to reusing groups of formulae along with layout and formatting, spreadsheets provide only limited support. Most users rely on copy and paste, which is easy to learn and use, but maintaining several copies can be tedious and error-prone. We present the concept of Gridlets, an abstraction over calculation and presentation applicable in common use case scenarios. Using the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework, we compare Gridlets to copy/paste and sheet-defined functions. We find that Gridlets are consistent with the spreadsheet paradigm, enable users to take advantage of secondary notation, and make common edit operations less viscous and less error-prone.},

abstract = {AI-powered code assistants, such as Copilot, are quickly becoming a ubiquitous component of contemporary coding contexts. Among these environments, computational notebooks, such as Jupyter, are of particular interest as they provide rich interface affordances that interleave code and output in a manner that allows for both exploratory and presentational work. Despite their popularity, little is known about the appropriate design of code assistants in notebooks. We investigate the potential of code assistants in computational notebooks by creating a design space (reified from a survey of extant tools) and through an interview-design study (with 15 practicing data scientists). Through this work, we identify challenges and opportunities for future systems in this space, such as the value of disambiguation for tasks like data visualization, the potential of tightly scoped domain-specific tools (like linters), and the importance of polite assistants.},

abstract = {Version control systems typically rely on a patch language, heuristic patch synthesis algorithms like diff, and three-way merge algorithms. Standard patch languages and merge algorithms often fail to identify conflicts correctly when there are multiple edits to one line of code or code is relocated. This paper introduces Grove, a collaborative structure editor calculus that eliminates patch synthesis and three-way merge algorithms entirely. Instead, patches are derived directly from the log of the developer’s edit actions and all edits commute, i.e. the repository state forms a commutative replicated data type (CmRDT). To handle conflicts that can arise due to code relocation, the core datatype in Grove is a labeled directed multi-graph with uniquely identified vertices and edges. All edits amount to edge insertion and deletion, with deletion being permanent. To support tree-based editing, we define a decomposition from graphs into groves, which are a set of syntax trees with conflicts—including local, relocation, and unicyclic relocation conflicts—represented explicitly using holes and references between trees. Finally, we define a type error localization system for groves that enjoys a totality property, i.e. all editor states in Grove are statically meaningful, so developers can use standard editor services while working to resolve these explicitly represented conflicts. The static semantics is defined as a bidirectional marking system in line with recent work, with gradual typing employed to handle situations where errors and conflicts prevent type determination. We then layer on a unification-based type inference system to opportunistically fill type holes and fail gracefully when no solution exists. We mechanize the metatheory of Grove using the Agda theorem prover. We implement these ideas as the Grove Workbench, which generates the necessary data structures and algorithms in OCaml given a syntax tree specification.},

abstract = {Data scientists, researchers, and clerks often create web automation programs to perform repetitive yet essential tasks, such as data scraping and data entry. However, existing web automation systems lack mechanisms for defining conditional behaviors where the system can intelligently filter candidate content based on semantic filters (e.g., extract texts based on key ideas or images based on entity relationships). We introduce SemanticOn, a system that enables users to specify, refine, and incorporate visual and textual semantic conditions in web automation programs via two methods: natural language description via prompts or information highlighting. Users can coordinate with SemanticOn to refine the conditions as the program continuously executes or reclaim manual control to repair errors. In a user study, participants completed a series of conditional web automation tasks. They reported that SemanticOn helped them effectively express and refine their semantic intent by utilizing visual and textual conditions.},
